## Summary: Modeled user churn from ride share data

Using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Pyplot, performed EDA and feature engineering on rideshare data to predict churn. 
Interpreted resulting model output to make business recommendations. 

Recommendations included improving the android app interface, as Android use was a predictor of churn. 
Another recommendation was to investigate the differences between cities in the data set to see if those conditions could be replicated. 
Members in one city were much less likely to churn. The differences in the cities could include something actionable, 
if, for instance, the marketing campaign in the low-churn city was different than that in the higher churn cities, or if the availability of drivers adn time-to-pickup is less there.
